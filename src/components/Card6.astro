			As mentioned previously, each bedroom is connected to a private greenhouse. Our greenhouses have resources for food and oxygen. In these greenhouses, oxygen is flowing through air vents and pipes spreading all the way through the base. Each greenhouse has a system called daylight and nighttime mode. This is where it is able to switch the darkness and brightness for the plants to grow at a steady rate.
